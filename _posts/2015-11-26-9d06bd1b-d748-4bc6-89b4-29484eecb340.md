MJD Photography

As
a freelance photographer I see the world as a collection of images and 
moments. I like to be in the moment and travel and work in a range of 
locations. I love living and working in the outdoors and photography is 
my way of capturing and sharing the life, beauty and movement all around
us. The vistas, the details and the people. The

With a background in Alpine Rescue, and working/training in industry, I get to be privvy to some pretty amazing things. 

I
specialise in outdoor, winter imagery and high risk operational 
environments. But I'm never one to shy away from a photographic task.

I am always on the lookout for new projects and am happy to help you realise your vision.
